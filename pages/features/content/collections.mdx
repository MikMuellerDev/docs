# Collections 

Collections is a feature that enables teachers to group and organize courses based on similar themes, topics, or learning objectives.

By using collections, learners can easily navigate through a variety of courses that are relevant to their interests and goals.

Furthermore, collections can be used to create personalized learning paths that cater to the unique needs and preferences of individuals (will be supported in a future update)

With collections, users can also save time and effort by accessing all relevant courses in one place, instead of having to search for them individually. In addition, collections can serve as a tool for instructors and administrators to provide a more structured and coherent learning experience to their learners, by grouping courses in a logical and meaningful way.
