Trails are a key feature on Learnhouse that enables teachers & students to track their progress through Courses.

By using Trails, teachers can effectively use quiz results and text-based course progression to tailor feedback in-person & remotely. It also lets students keep a track of their own progression through the course, and encourage increased self-determination & confidence.
