# Setting up a Dev environment

This is a guide to set up a dev environment for LearnHouse, it will guide you through the installation of the backend and the frontend.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Node.js 21.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Python 3.12.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
- macOS, Linux or Windows

## Backend configuration

<Steps>

### Get the repository

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/learnhouse/learnhouse
```

```shell copy
cd learnhouse
```

### Build & install LearnHouse

This will build & run the backend and the database docker images

```shell copy
docker-compose up -d
```

This will install all the dependencies needed for the backend

- A **Postgres** database
- A **Redis** server
- A **Collaboration** nodejs server
- _A built LearnHouse App\* (Frontend & Backend)_

<Callout type='info'>
You should **ignore** the Built LearnHouse App as it's not needed for the dev environment, in this case it will be useful only for installing learnhouse contents (Roles, Organization, Users in the database)

</Callout>

### Run the backend in dev mode

You'll need to modify the config file to enable the install mode

#### Go to the backend folder

```shell copy
cd apps/api
```

#### Install python dependencies

```shell copy
poetry install
```

#### Run the Backend in Dev mode

```shell copy
poetry run python app.py
```

<Callout type="info">To learn more about Configuration options, please refer to the [Configuration](/self-hosting/configuration) documentation</Callout>

#### Check the API

Go to [http://localhost:1338/docs/](http://localhost:1338/docs/)

</Steps>

## Frontend configuration

<Steps>
 
### Init the frontend

Go to the frontend folder

```shell copy
cd apps/web
```

This will install all the dependencies needed for the frontend, and for this you will need [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

```shell copy
pnpm i
```

Add an .env file in the front folder with the following content

```env filename="apps/web/.env" {1-2}
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_MULTI_ORG=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_DEFAULT_ORG=test
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_API_URL=http://localhost:1338/api/v1/
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:1338/
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_DOMAIN=localhost:3000
```

<Callout type="warning">Setting MultiOrg to true won't work locally for now, please set it to false</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  To learn about Organizations Hosting modes, please refer to the [Organization Hosting Modes](/self-hosting/organization-hosting-modes) documentation
</Callout>

Run the dev environment

```shell copy
pnpm run dev
```

### Configure your Organization as the default one

Copy this content to the .env file in the web folder

```env filename="apps/web/.env" {2}
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_MULTI_ORG=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_DEFAULT_ORG=default
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_API_URL=http://localhost:1338/api/v1/
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:1338/
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_DOMAIN=localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_COLLABORATION_WS_URL=wss://localhost:1998
```

Make sure to change the `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_DEFAULT_ORG` to the organization you want to set as the default one, you''l find the organization slug in the database in the `organizations` table

Here it is set to `default` which is the default organization created by the backend when you ran the backend in the previous steps

### Congratulations, you're done! ðŸŽ‰
