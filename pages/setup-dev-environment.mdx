# Setting up a dev environment

This is a guide to set up a dev environment for LearnHouse, it will guide you through the installation of the backend and the frontend.

Some parts are subject to automation in the future, making the process easier.

## Backend configuration

<Steps>
 
### Install Docker
 
To install Docker, follow the instructions for your operating system on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Get the repository

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/learnhouse/learnhouse
```

```shell copy
cd learnhouse
```

### Build & run the Backend

This will build & run the backend and the database docker images

```shell copy
docker-compose up -d
```

### Enable install mode

You'll need to modify the config file to enable the install mode

```env filename="./config/config.yaml" {6-7}
site_name: LearnHouse
site_description: LearnHouse is an open-source platform tailored for learning experiences.
contact_email: hi@learnhouse.app

general:
  development_mode: true
  install_mode: true
```

<Callout type="info" >
  To learn more about Configuration options, please refer to the [Configuration](/self-hosting/configuration) documentation
</Callout>
<Callout type="warning" >
  If using LearnHouse in production, please set the install mode and development mode to **false**
</Callout>
</Steps>

## Frontend configuration

<Steps>
 
### Init the frontend

Go to the frontend folder

```shell copy
cd apps/web
```

This will install all the dependencies needed for the frontend, and for this you will need [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

```shell copy
pnpm i
```

Add an .env file in the front folder with the following content

```env filename="apps/web/.env" {1-2}
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_MULTI_ORG=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_DEFAULT_ORG=test
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_API_URL=http://localhost:1338/api/v1/
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:1338/
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_DOMAIN=localhost:3000
```

<Callout type="warning">Setting MultiOrg to true won't work locally for now, please set it to false</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

</Callout>

Run the dev environment

```shell copy
pnpm run dev
```

### Get to the install page

Go to [http://localhost:3000/install](http://localhost:3000/install)

<br />
<img style={{ borderRadius: 10 }} quality={100} src="/img/pages/dev-env/install.png" alt="Hello" width={800} height={500} />

</Steps>

## Install LearnHouse

Create your Organization, Account and roles.

### Configure your Organization as the default one

```env filename="apps/web/.env" {2}
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_MULTI_ORG=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_DEFAULT_ORG=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ORG_SLUG
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_API_URL=http://localhost:1338/api/v1/
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:1338/
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_DOMAIN=localhost:3000
```
